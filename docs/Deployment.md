# Netlify Web deployment

The user resumed creating a new Netlify project and deploying the Web app on 2026-10-12. The CLI still reports the previous account authorization as pending, so a fresh authorization link has been requested. No project or deployment has been created yet. Apartment Sunday billing and automatic roads remain documented future gameplay work.

## Build and hosting configuration

- `netlify.toml` publishes `build/web` and runs `bash tool/build_netlify.sh` for Git-based Netlify builds.
- The Bash entry point installs the Flutter version in `toolchain.json`, verifies its exact Git revision, resolves the checked-in lockfile and invokes `tool/build_web.dart`. `.gitattributes` preserves LF line endings for this Linux build entry point.
- The Web builder bundles renderer/fonts locally and generates the versioned service worker and asset manifest. Publish the whole output directory, including `canvaskit/` and `assets/`.
- The Netlify fallback serves `index.html` for client navigation while allowing existing files to resolve normally. Stable Flutter output names revalidate on the host; the application's versioned cache handles offline reloads.
- `.netlify/` is ignored. CLI linkage belongs to the local workstation and must not be committed. No access token belongs in the repository or Web output.

## Local upload

Authorize/link the intended project and build the Web release:

```powershell
./.tools/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart.exe run tool/build_web.dart
netlify deploy --prod --dir build/web --no-build
```

The `--no-build` flag uploads the already-built output. A manual upload does not by itself connect GitHub continuous deployment. Record the actual project/deploy identity, live URL and whether Git-based builds are connected after deployment succeeds.

## Offline and saves

The first visit needs connectivity to install the app's resources. Later reloads work offline once caching completes. The current app stores five local profile slots in browser storage tied to the live origin. Preview URLs and custom domains have separate storage; opening a new origin does not move existing saves. Browser storage clearing removes local profiles. Updates activate after previous app clients close.

## Deployment status

**Resumed; waiting for Netlify account authorization.** No Netlify project, live deployment or GitHub continuous-deployment connection has been created. On 2026-10-12, formatting (19 files unchanged), Flutter analysis, all 14 tests, the 158-file runtime catalog validator and the release Web build passed. All 201 offline-cache resources exist in the output, including all 158 runtime assets. `.netlify/` remains ignored. The release is ready for upload once account authorization completes; these checks do not indicate a published site. Local Android and Web builds and the GitHub source repository remain available.
