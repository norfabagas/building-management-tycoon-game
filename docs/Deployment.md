# Netlify Web deployment

The user requested a new Netlify project and Web deployment on 2026-10-12. Publish the existing Flutter application and approved assets as a static HTTPS site. Hosting does not introduce accounts, a game backend, analytics or cloud saves. Apartment Sunday billing and automatic roads remain documented future gameplay work.

## Build and hosting configuration

- `netlify.toml` publishes `build/web` and runs `bash tool/build_netlify.sh` for Git-based Netlify builds.
- The Bash entry point installs the Flutter version in `toolchain.json`, verifies its exact Git revision, resolves the checked-in lockfile and invokes `tool/build_web.dart`. `.gitattributes` preserves LF line endings for this Linux build entry point.
- The Web builder bundles renderer/fonts locally and generates the versioned service worker and asset manifest. Publish the whole output directory, including `canvaskit/` and `assets/`.
- The Netlify fallback serves `index.html` for client navigation while allowing existing files to resolve normally. Stable Flutter output names revalidate on the host; the application's versioned cache handles offline reloads.
- `.netlify/` is ignored. CLI linkage belongs to the local workstation and must not be committed. No access token belongs in the repository or Web output.

## Local upload

After linking the intended project and building the Web release:

```powershell
./.tools/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart.exe run tool/build_web.dart
netlify deploy --prod --dir build/web --no-build
```

The `--no-build` flag uploads the already-built output. A manual upload does not by itself connect GitHub continuous deployment. Record the actual project/deploy identity, live URL and whether Git-based builds are connected after deployment succeeds.

## Offline and saves

The first visit needs connectivity to install the app's resources. Later reloads work offline once caching completes. The current app stores five local profile slots in browser storage tied to the live origin. Preview URLs and custom domains have separate storage; opening a new origin does not move existing saves. Browser storage clearing removes local profiles. Updates activate after previous app clients close.

## Deployment status

Configuration is prepared. Bash syntax, TOML parsing, all 48 local Web manifest paths and the `.netlify/` ignore rule pass checks. The user must authorize the Netlify CLI account connection before project creation/publication can finish; the authorization ticket is still pending. No Netlify project or live deploy has been confirmed. Do not interpret a prepared config as a successful deployment.
