# Netlify Web deployment

The Web app is published at [building-management-tycoon-game.netlify.app](https://building-management-tycoon-game.netlify.app). The user resumed deployment on 2026-10-12 and authorized the Netlify CLI. A new project was created in the `norfabagas` team and the validated Web release was uploaded to production. Apartment Sunday billing and automatic roads remain documented future gameplay work.

## Build and hosting configuration

- `netlify.toml` publishes `build/web` and runs `bash tool/build_netlify.sh` for Git-based Netlify builds.
- The Bash entry point installs the Flutter version in `toolchain.json`, verifies its exact Git revision, resolves the checked-in lockfile and invokes `tool/build_web.dart`. `.gitattributes` preserves LF line endings for this Linux build entry point.
- The Web builder bundles renderer/fonts locally and generates the versioned service worker and asset manifest. Publish the whole output directory, including `canvaskit/` and `assets/`.
- The Netlify fallback serves `index.html` for client navigation while allowing existing files to resolve normally. Stable Flutter output names revalidate on the host; the application's versioned cache handles offline reloads.
- `.netlify/` is ignored. CLI linkage belongs to the local workstation and must not be committed. No access token belongs in the repository or Web output.

## Local upload

Authorize/link the intended project and build the Web release:

```powershell
./.tools/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart.exe run tool/build_web.dart
netlify deploy --prod --dir build/web --no-build
```

The `--no-build` flag uploads the already-built output. A manual upload does not by itself connect GitHub continuous deployment. Record the actual project/deploy identity, live URL and whether Git-based builds are connected after deployment succeeds.

## Offline and saves

The first visit needs connectivity to install the app's resources. Later reloads work offline once caching completes. The current app stores five local profile slots in browser storage tied to the live origin. Preview URLs and custom domains have separate storage; opening a new origin does not move existing saves. Browser storage clearing removes local profiles. Updates activate after previous app clients close.

## Deployment status

**Published on 2026-10-12.**

- Project: `building-management-tycoon-game`, team `norfabagas`.
- Project ID: `326e5871-656b-4f7b-87c1-664e001d4ac4`.
- Production URL: [Open the game](https://building-management-tycoon-game.netlify.app).
- Dashboard: [Netlify project](https://app.netlify.com/projects/building-management-tycoon-game).
- Deploy ID: `6accd3213b81fa43c5ced96c`, confirmed `ready` by the Netlify API.
- Deploy details: [Production deployment](https://app.netlify.com/projects/building-management-tycoon-game/deploys/6accd3213b81fa43c5ced96c).
- Uploaded release: source checkout `341bf18`, using `netlify deploy --prod --dir build/web --no-build`.
- Deployment mode: manual CLI upload. GitHub continuous deployment is **not connected**; future pushes alone do not publish the site. Build locally and run the upload command above for updates, or explicitly connect Git builds later.
- Local project linkage remains in ignored `.netlify/state.json`; credentials are stored by the CLI outside tracked project files.

Before upload, formatting (19 files unchanged), Flutter analysis, all 14 tests, the 158-file runtime catalog validator and the release Web build passed. All 201 offline-cache resources exist in the output, including all 158 runtime assets.

After publication, the HTTPS profile screen displayed the BM mark, approved district illustration and five empty slots. The root page and client-navigation fallback returned HTTP 200. Published runtime manifest contents match the repository's 158-asset catalog. HTTP checks confirmed the offline cache manifest/worker, main bundle, bootstrap, CanvasKit Wasm, logo, character animation and music resource with their expected content types. Host cache revalidation and `nosniff` headers are present. Local offline reload was verified during initial setup; a disconnected reload on this live origin has not been repeated. The page displays Netlify's hosting badge. Current gameplay limitations remain in [Setup.md](Setup.md) and [Project.md](Project.md).
